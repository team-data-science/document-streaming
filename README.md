# document-streaming
Repository for the Document streaming capstone projects

Outlook:

- Deploy the streamlit app as docker (build and add in dockerfile)
- Deploy the whole platform with all containers on a cloud platform of your choice
- Add an API between Streamlit and MongoDB so that Streamlit doesnt have to be directly connected with MongoDB (User& Password)
